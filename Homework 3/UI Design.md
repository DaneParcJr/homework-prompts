# UI Design
Part of being a front end developer is being able to utilize html and css to create ui. A front-end dev won't necessarily be creating webpages so that won't be the focus of this lesson. However, a front-end dev will be expected to create ui elements/widgets that fit into an application. To that end the goal of this homework assignment is to flex the part of your skillset, by making you create ui widgets with pure css and html, no javascript or third party libraries. Straight vanilla. This is becuase it will better help you understand what those libraries are doing behind the scenes and to deal with any UI issues that crop up. 

With that said, let's jump into what will be expected of you!

## Task 1: Choose a difficulty level
To begin with you will get to choose (or work on multiple) your difficulty level for the assignment, effectively what you're gonna work on.

## Task 2: Build the UI
Once you've chosen what difficulty you'll tackle, you can then begin working on the ui element itself. Remember that in order to pass, you need to actually utilize html and css only. No JavaScript or Third Party Libraries will be allowed! Don't worry about images, creating an empty box with a color is more than enough to get the point across.

## Task 3: GitHub
In keeping up with our use of practical skills, you'll use github to upload your assignment's code!

## Task 4: Style Points
Be creative! While copying a design will still net you a pass! Being creative will net you extra gold stars! For example, you could just copy the design of the hard level task, but you could also play around with spacing, colors, font-sizes, font-families, etc. To create a new look and feel!

# The Difficulty Levels
Remember these are just suggestions you don't have to copy these layouts 1-1 but you can if you are having trouble flexing that creative part of your brain! That does take practice!
